description: A hilarious journey living with my Japanese roommate — aka Bed Potato — who mastered the art of studying from bed.

Everyone knows I got a Japanese roommate three weeks ago.    
大家都知道我三個星期前有了一個日本室友。    

His name is Taizao... but I usually call him **"Bed Potato."**  
他叫大藏… 但我通常都叫他 **"床上馬鈴薯"**。  

He’s a smart and diligent guy, and he scored over 850 on the TOEIC when he first came here.  
他是個聰明又勤奮的人，他的TOEIC 超過 850分。  

I thought, *"Wow, this guy must have some kind of secret study technique."*  
我當時心想：「哇！這傢伙肯定有什麼學習秘訣！」  

So I observed him for a while... and I realized he only has **two modes**:  
所以我觀察了他一陣子… 然後我發現他只有**兩種模式**：  

1. **Crazy Study Hard Mode**  
   **瘋狂學習模式**  
   - On weekends, he can write 5 full essays like without even stepping outside.  
   **在週末，他可以輕鬆寫出五篇完整的文章，連門都不出。**

2. **Lie on the Bed and Study Mode**  
   **躺在床上學習模式**  
   - He can stay on bed, reading and studying all the night until 12:30 AM without falling asleep and while resting at the same time.  
   **他可以躺在床上讀書學習，一直撐到凌晨12:30，不會睡著，同時也在休息。**

That’s all. No other modes.  
就這兩種，沒有別的模式了。  

I saw him always lying on bed, reading all the time. it looked so powerful, like some genius-level skill.  
我天天看他躺在床上，還能一直看書，感覺這技能超強，簡直像什麼天才絕技。  

I thought, *"I need to learn this skill too!"*  
我心想：「我也要學會這招！」  

So I tried imitating him… laid on my bed with a book…  
所以我試著模仿他… 拿本書躺在床上…  

But instead of studying, I immediately fell asleep. And I tried many times.  
但我不是在學習，**我是直接睡著了**。而且我試了很多次，結果都一樣。  

Turns out, this wasn’t a study mode — it was a **hibernation mode.**  
結果發現，這根本不是學習模式… **這是冬眠模式**。  

One day, he told me, *"The teacher didn’t give him any homework today."*  
有一天他跟我說：「今天老師沒給作業。」  

I thought if I were your teacher, I’d probably be exhausted because I asked you to write one essay, and you gave me five.  
我想我若是你的老師，應該會感覺很累，因為我告訴你寫一篇散文，你給我五篇

Then after dinner, he just went back to bed... and stayed there the whole night.  
然後吃完晚飯，他又躺回床上… **一整晚沒動過**。  

Recently, Bed Potato said he wants to find an internship.  
最近，**床上馬鈴薯**說他想找個實習工作。  

He told me, *"In Kenya, elephants often destroy village buildings. But bees can scare elephants away."*  
他告訴我：「在肯亞，大象經常會破壞村莊的建築，但蜜蜂可以嚇跑大象。」  

So now... he wants to **intern with beekeeping companies in Kenya.**  
所以現在… **他想去肯亞找蜜蜂的相關公司實習**。  

I hope he can find an internship.  
我希望他能夠找到一個實習工作

I don’t know which one is crazier, the idea of bee research, or this guy might actually do it... **on his bed.**  
我不知道哪件事更瘋狂， 是他這個蜜蜂研究的點子，還是他可能真的會 **躺在床上** 完成這個實習。  

Just kidding!  
開玩笑的啦！  

I hope he tries something new or take advantage, he’ll develop leadership and courage.  
我希望他能嘗試點新東西，或者挑戰自己，這樣他會變得更有領導力和勇氣。  

He might even grow into a big outdoor potato.  
說不定他還能變成一顆戶外大馬鈴薯呢！

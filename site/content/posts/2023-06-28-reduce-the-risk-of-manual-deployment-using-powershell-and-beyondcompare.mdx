## Purpose
To reduce the time spent and human error on manual deployment, the deployment method for the C# API has been changed.

## Deploy flow
Firstly, all deployment DLLs must be committed to ApiArtifact, which can be accessed by navigating to the Publish folder at 
```
https://github.com/XyzCom/ApiArtifact.
```
Next, connect remotely to server and right-click deploy-api.ps1 on the desktop and select "Run with PowerShell". This will pull down the latest DLLs.

Select the DLLs to be deployed, and then manually click "Copy to Side " folder as shown in the image below.

## Create ApiArtifact repo and git clone in deploy server ( And always upload all )

## create powershell file ( compare-deploy-binaray.ps1  ) 
```
git pull 

$LOCAL = "C:\Workspace\ApiArtifact\bin"
$REMOTE = "C:\inetpub\Web\bin"

$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Beyond Compare 4\" 
$filters = "/filters=-web.config"
BCompare.exe /excludefilter="web.config"  "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" $filters

```

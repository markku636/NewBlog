## Why do you learn english ?
This is good question ?  but you sure get the result. 

## What do I learn English for / 目的
Two years ago, I went on a business trip to the U.S., but I couldn’t say anything. So, I started learning English.    
二年前，我去美國出差，但我一句話也說不出來，因為那種有口說不出來的感覺，所以我開始學英文。  

I learn engish for   
* I can use English to create more connections with diverse nationality people.
* When I write multi-langs articles, I can attract more audience and impact more people.
* I can communicate with foreigners.
* When a foreigner gets lost, I can help them.

## To be honest  
English can't immediately change your career or work a lot, and you can't learn very well in a short time. You should keep learning English.    

So many guys want to look for a foreign job, but foreign companies barely hire people without experience, and they care more about your personality and your core skill. For example:  

* Do you have any extra contributions in XXX?  
* Are you qualified enough?  
* Does your experience match the skills?  

Actually, in the human resource market, it is easy to hire people who speak English well. So, English just supports your core skill.  

## Exam  & Usefulness 
After taking TOEIC, I found Example and Useful are different sides, and they are in different directions.

Then I discussed with my roommate. he got over 850 scores in TOEIC.

The bed potato said if TOEIC can prove my English very well, I didn't study in a langs school.

For example, when you are talking with someone, you use TOEIC's deep words.
l
But many companies have minimum license requirements in English to filter someone.

For me, the most important thing is usefulness for a limited time.

## What is the most important thing in communication?  

I really like the speaker who is Nvidia's co-founder, Jen-Hsun Huang.  
When he gives speeches, he always uses simple words and speaks slowly. It’s easy to understand him.

Actually, speaking is not just about knowing English. It’s also about:  
- Listening  
- Sharing ideas  
- Giving opinions  
- Talking about experiences  
- Showing value  
- Having a good attitude  

## Finally, understand what you really want and why you learn English

## Learning speaking journey / 口說的學習旅程
Two years ago, I went on a business trip to the U.S., but I couldn't say anything. So, I started learning English.  
二年前，我去美國出差，但我一句話也說不出來，所以我開始學英文

### **Stage 1: Single Words**  
At the first stage, I could only use simple single words to answer the question.  
從一開始只能用單字拼湊回答，  

### **Stage 2: Thinking and Translating**  
Then, I was improved, I could translate into English from Chinese thinking while speaking.   
接著慢慢進步到腦中用中文思考邊翻譯邊回答，  

### **Stage 3: Speaking with Mistakes**  
In the next stage, I could directly express ideas using multiple sentences with English thinking or another way describe answer, but I often lost grammar and conjunctions.  
再接著，可以用英文思考，回答也變得比較直覺，只能用很多句子很直覺地去表達一件事，但也常常忘了時態、文法及連接詞，  

### **Stage 4: Stuck and Stopping**  
After studying at a language school for a while, I realized my speaking progress have bottleneck.  
到了語言學校一陣子後，發現口說的進步停滯不前，  

### **Stage 5: Better Answers**  
So, I told with my teacher and adjusted my learning approach.

Instead of focusing on the number of answers,  
不再只專注於回答問題的數量，  

I began practicing how to give more complete, content-rich, and natural responses.  
而是練習如何說出更完整、更有內容、更自然的回答。

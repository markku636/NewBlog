## Why do you learn English?  
This is a good question, but are you sure you know the answer?  
你為什麼學英文？這是一個好問題，但你確定你真的知道答案嗎？  

## In my case, what do I start to learn English / 目的  
Two years ago, I went on a business trip to the U.S., but I couldn’t say anything. So, I started learning English.  
兩年前，我去美國出差，但我一句話也說不出來。因為那種有口說不出的感覺，所以我開始學英文。 [Story](https://blog.markkulab.net/why-learn-english/) 

## To be honest  
English can't immediately change your career or work a lot, and you can't learn very well in a short time. You should keep learning English.  
老實說，英文無法立刻改變你的職業或工作，而且你也不可能在短時間內學得很好。你必須持續學習英文。  

Some guys want to look for a foreign job, but foreign companies barely hire people without experience in Taiwan, and they care more about your personality and your core skill. For example:  
很多人想找外國工作，但外國公司在台灣很少會僱用沒有經驗的人。他們更在意你的個性和核心技能。例如：  

* Do you have any extra contributions in XXX?  
* 你在 XXX 領域有額外的貢獻嗎？  
* Are you qualified enough?  
* 你的資格足夠嗎？  
* Does your experience match the skills?  
* 你的經歷符合所需技能嗎？  

Actually, in the job market, it’s easy to find people who speak English well. The most important thing is your core skill, and English simply supports that.

其實，在就業市場上，很容易找到英文說得很好的人。最重要的是你的核心技能，英文只是輔助工具。

## Exam vs Practical English  
After taking TOEIC, I found TOEIC and usefulness in English are different sides, and they are in different directions.  
考完TOEIC後，我發現「TOEIC」和「實用性」是不同的方面，而且方向也不一樣。  

Then I discussed with my roommate. He got over 850 scores in TOEIC.  
後來我和我室友討論，他TOEIC考了850多分。  

The bed potato said if TOEIC can prove my English very well, I didn't study in a langs school.  
那個“床馬鈴薯”說，如果TOEIC能證明我英文很好，那我就不用去語言學校了。  

For example, when you are talking with someone, you use TOEIC's deep words.  
比如說，當你跟別人講話時，你用TOEIC的高難度單字。  

But some companies have minimum license requirements in English to filter someone.  
但一些公司會設英文的最低證書門檻來篩選人。  

For me, the most important thing is usefulness for a limited time.  
對我來說，最重要的是在有限時間內讓英文變得實用。  

## What is the most important thing in communication?  

I really like the speaker who is Nvidia's co-founder, Jen-Hsun Huang.  
我最喜歡的演講者之一是Nvidia的聯合創辦人黃仁勳（Jen-Hsun Huang）。  

When he gives speeches, he always uses simple words and speaks slowly. It’s easy to understand him.  
他演講時總是用簡單的詞，講得很慢，讓人很容易理解。

So he can attract a wider audience and make a bigger impact.
因此，他能吸引更廣泛的觀眾，並產生更大的影響力。

Actually, speaking is not just about knowing English. It’s also about:  
其實，會說英文不只是會單字而已，還包括：  

- Listening 傾聽  
- Sharing ideas 分享想法  
- Giving opinions 提出觀點  
- Talking about experiences 分享經歷  
- Showing value 展現價值  
- Having a good attitude 保持良好態度  

Actually when I study one months, I just discovery that Why do I learn english.

## Rethink  / 重新思考

There are many courses in school, such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing, but it’s impossible to master everything in the limited time. The key is to find the most valuable and interesting parts that align with your goals and focus on those.
學校有很多課程聽、說、讀、寫樣樣都有，但不可能在有限的時間全部都學得很精，找出最有價值、最有興趣的部分接近你的目標來專注學習，才是關鍵。

Instead of chasing exam scores, I chose to prioritize learning English that I can immediately use in my daily life and work. For me, practicality matters more.
比起追求考試成績，我選擇優先學習那些能立刻在生活和工作中派上用場的英文，對我來說，實用性更重要。

I sorted out what I can do with English
我整理了我能用英文做到的事情

I can use English to build connections with people from different nationalities.
我可以用英文和不同國籍的人建立更多聯繫，拓展人脈。

When I write multilingual articles, I can attract a wider audience.
當我寫多語言文章時，可以吸引更廣的觀眾，讓我的想法傳得更遠、影響更多人。

I can communicate with foreigners more confidently and naturally.
我可以更有自信、更自然地和外國人交流，讓對話不再卡住。

If a foreigner gets lost, I can step up and help them.
當外國人迷路時，我可以主動幫助他們，不再只是比手畫腳。

## Ending / 結尾

Finally, figure out what you really want, why you want to learn English, and where you can use it.  
最後，弄清楚你真正想要的是什麼，以及為什麼要學英文，你可以將英文用在那

In the end, ,Influence has never been about what you know; it’s always about what you do.  
最後，影響力從來的不是你會什麼，而是你做了什麼

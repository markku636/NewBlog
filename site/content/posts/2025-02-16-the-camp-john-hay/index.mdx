Camp John Hay used to be an American camp in Baguio, but it has since been turned into a resort.

And one more important thing is the food is amazing!  
Thank God! The food is delicious!

I really wanted to try horse riding since it’s very affordable. It costs just 300 PHP for 30 minutes.

This was my first time riding a horse. My horse’s name was Chocolate.  
He was very gentle!  
I rode Chocolate up the hill for 60 minutes. During the ride, he pooped once and peed twice and a lot!  
This is a very special and unforgettable experience!

Continuing to ride for a while，I felt like a horse was obeying me.  

At one point, I asked, "Why not stop here?"

The horse trainer said, "He is wee wee," and then I heard the sound.  

That’s when I truly understood what wee-wee and poop-poop meant.  

I was worried it might get on me!  

Luckily, everything was fine. Nothing happened.  

After that, I visited the Camp John Hay cabins (the soldiers' houses).

Next time, I probably will try hiking , marathon, golf or other activities.

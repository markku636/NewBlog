## Introduction

Since I just started studying at a language school in Baguio, it felt a little bit boring on weekends because aside from studying, we could usually go hiking and drinking alcohol,so I began researching Mount Ulap and tried to invite classmates to join me. Finally, I discovered that some of my classmates are also insterested in hiking, and I got a Japanese roomate. Together, we formed a team to climb Mount Ulap.   

## About Mt. Ulap

Mt.Ulap, located in Benguet, Philippines, is a popular hiking destination known for its stunning landscapes and breathtaking views. The trail spans about 8 kilometers and typically takes 7 to 8 hours for a round trip, depending on your pace.  

### **Highlights:**  
- **Gungal Rock:** A thrilling spot for adventurous photos, offering spectacular views.  
- **Grassland Scenery:** Picturesque rolling hills that resemble a mini New Zealand.  
- **Sea of Clouds:** Best experienced in the early morning under ideal weather conditions.  
- **Pride Rock:** A rock formation reminiscent of the iconic scene from *The Lion King*.  

### **Details:**  
- **Elevation:** 1,847 feet tall
- **Difficulty:** Suitable for beginners and intermediate hikers. 

### **Transportation Options**  

Since the tour guides are located at Ampucao Elementary School in Itogon, we have two options to get there, we must arrive around 5 to 6 a.m. 

1. **Jeepney from Itogon Jeepney Terminal to Ampucao Elementary School**  
   - The first jeepney trip departs at 6 a.m.  
   - This is a budget-friendly option but may require an extra waiting time.

2. **Taxi to Ampucao Elementary School**  
   - A more convenient choice if we need to arrive earlier or prefer a direct route.  

P.S. Taxi in Baguio operate for 24 hours,and grab can't support long distance location.

### Schedule & Time
We decieded to set off on Saturday based on Windy forecast, and more experienced people said the tour gides will started climbing the mountain around 7 a.m. and we need to wake up early at 4:00 am ,and depart from the lobby at 4:30 am,and we must submit request to academy in advance.

### Risks and Precautions
1. Weather - The weather that we cannot control. If it's raining heavily, it will be cancelled. 
2. Transportation - The transportation was unpredictable. Jeepneys didn’t have a schedule, and sometimes we could find a taxi.
3. Your Condition - The weather changes a lot in Baguio. If you feel unwell because the hiking trail is too long, you will be uncomfortable.  Please stay in the school.
4. Step on the poop - There are a few cow over there, so you can see the poop everywhere,and you have to watch out your way.

### Important Reminders for Your Trip
* Bring Your Student ID Card – Make sure to bring your ID card, as it will help you get a discount from your tour guide and a reduced foreign entrance fee.
* Prepare Small Change – Have some spare change ready for taking the jeepney.
* Pack a Raincoat – Be prepared for unpredictable weather with a raincoat.
* Bring Two Bottles of Water – Stay hydrated by bringing at least two bottles of regular bottled water.
* Set an Alarm for 4:00 AM – Ensure you wake up early by setting an alarm at 4:00 AM.(depends on your location)

## D-Day
We were worried about finding a taxi, but it turned out to be easy in the morning.   
We took a taxi to the Itogon Jeepney Terminal, but when we arrived, we found out the first trip was at 6 a.m., not 5 a.m.   
So, we asked the driver to take us directly to Ampucao Elementary School.

Walking and walking, we were so lucky to witness the sunrise

When we found a tour guide and paid all the fees, we started hiking.

We passed by stones like Lion king's pride rock, but there were too many people, so we had to use p-pictures later.

Because there were so many people standing on Pride Rock taking pictures, we gave up waiting in line, but I have no regrets! Thanks to technology, we've all virtually been to Pride Rock.

Then we arrived at the summit of Mt. Ulap.

Finally, We hiked like a super-fast train, taking only 4 hours and 30 minutes! , and we are all got home safely.  
The scenery at Mt.Ulap is very beautiful, so I highly recommend hiking there.

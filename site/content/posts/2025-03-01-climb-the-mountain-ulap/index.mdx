## Introduction

I am interested in hiking more then the drink something ,and I have height blood presssure,so I cannot drink too more.
but don't worried my healthy is improving.

## Action 
Since just studied at school was very boring,so I started collecting about Mount Ulap and tried to invite classmates to join me. 
I discovered that some of classmate also insterested in hiking, and I got a Jpanese roomate, then we formed a team to cliumb Mount Ulap.   

## MT.Ulap Information 

Mt. Ulap, located in Benguet, Philippines, is a popular hiking destination known for its stunning landscapes and breathtaking views. The trail spans approximately 8 kilometers and typically takes 7 to 8 hours for a round trip, depending on your pace.  

### **Highlights:**

### **Transportation**  

Since the tour guides are located at Ampucao Elementary School in Itogon, we have two options to get there, aiming to arrive around 5 to 6 a.m.:  

1. **Jeepney from Itogon Jeepney Terminal to Ampucao Elementary School**  
   - The first jeepney trip departs at 6 a.m.  
   - This is a budget-friendly option but may require an early wait.

2. **Taxi to Ampucao Elementary School**  
   - A more convenient choice if we need to arrive earlier or prefer a direct route.  

P.S. Taxi in Baguio operate for 24 hours,and grab can't support taking too fa

### Schedule & Time
We decieded to set off on Saturday based on Windy forecast, and most senior said the tour gides will started climbing the mountain around 7 a.m. and we need to wake up early at 4:00 am ,and depart from the lobby at 4:30 am,and we must submit request to academy in advance.

### Risk 
1. Weather - The weather that we cannot control. if it's raining heavily, we will cancelled. 
2. Transportation - The transportation was unpredictable. Jeepneys didn’t have a schedule, and sometimes we could find a taxi.
3. Condition - The weather changes a lot. if you feel unwell because the hiking trail is too long, you will uncomfortable, please stay in the school.
4. Step on the poop - There are a few cow over there, so you can see the poop everywhere,and you have to be careful where you step

2. Prepare some change for taking the Jeepey
3. Raincoat
4. Two bottle of water 
5. Set alarm at 4:00 am

## D-Day
We were worried about finding a taxi, but it turned out to be easy in the morning.   
We took a taxi to the Itogon Jeepney Terminal, but when we arrived, we found out the first trip was at 6 a.m., not 5 a.m.   
So, we asked the driver to take us directly to Ampucao Elementary School.

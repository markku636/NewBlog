## Introduction
Since I just studied at a language school in Baguio, it felt a little bit boring, because aside from studying, we could usually go hiking and drink alcohol.

So I started collecting about Mount Ulap and tried to invite classmates to join me. Finally, I discovered that some of classmate also insterested in hiking, and I got a Jpanese roomate, then we formed a team to cliumb Mount Ulap.

Since the tour guides are located at Ampucao Elementary School in Itogon, we have two options to get there, aiming to arrive around 5 to 6 a.m.:  

1. **Jeepney from Itogon Jeepney Terminal to Ampucao Elementary School**  
   - The first jeepney trip departs at 6 a.m.  
   - This is a budget-friendly option but may require an early wait.

## D-Day
We were worried about finding a taxi, but it turned out to be easy in the morning.   
We took a taxi to the Itogon Jeepney Terminal, but when we arrived, we found out the first trip was at 6 a.m., not 5 a.m.   
So, we asked the driver to take us directly to Ampucao Elementary School.

We passed by stones like Lion king's pride rock, but there were too many people, so we had to use p-pictures later.

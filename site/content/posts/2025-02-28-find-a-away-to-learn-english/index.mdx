## Introduction
Our group class's teacher was absent today, So we got a substitute teacher.  
The teacher who teach us "how to learn english" and inspire us to learn english in a better way.

## Common sense   
Typically,a normal person learns English in three years,even if you study very hard,it will take 6 months with 12 hours every day.  

Any language school is not magic school,so they don't cast spells which will instantly make anyone fluent.

## Forgetting cycle 
Sudy -> Learn -> Rarely use -> Go back to your country -> Forgot all   

## Basic of Learn Language 
You must know your brain how to learn 

See -> Say > Hear -> See -> Say -> Hear ...

Learning any language requires constant repetition.  

## Is just sudied is enough? 
When we were children, we spent 20% to study anything and 80% to practice, for adults, it's the opposite.
That doesn’t make sense!

## What's the importance of learning english ?

The most important thing is "Find what way works for youself!" 

How to find the way for yourself ?  

You must find something you are interested in.

Have you ever experienced hearing a couple fighting and a crowd buzzing in a restaurant?   
I think that moment you have a power of listening skill even though it's very noisy,for you are very interested in it. 

Actually, when you interested to something, you will learn it quickly,so do something related to your hobby with english is a good way. 

## In My Case  
I really love writing something for my blog, and I spent some time watching talk show videos. I usually go jogging twice a week.  

### **Actions**  
I thought that is right. I must change the methods to learn English.
- Practice writing articles in English.  
- Improve listening skills by watching talk shows.  
- Set all system languages on my phone and PC to English.  
- Listen to English audio regularly.  
- Watch movies with captions.  

The most importance of things is  
If you leave your country to learn English, don’t rely on the same methods you used in your home country. Otherwise, the experience will be similar to studying in your own country.

### **Teacher's Suggestions**  

#### **How to Prepare for TOEIC**  
- Increase listening speed.  
- Familiarize yourself with different accents.  

#### **Should You Turn Off Captions When Watching Movies?**  
If your English level is still low and you only understand a few words, watching without captions might be too challenging. In this case, turning on captions is more effective.  

Watching **50 short videos (5 minutes each) per week** is a great way to improve.  

#### **How to Memorize Vocabulary?**  
As a child, memorizing vocabulary was easy, but now it takes much longer to remember just one word.  

Even in our native language, we don’t memorize vocabulary,we learn it naturally through use.  

Instead of just making sentences, try creating questions and answers. This method is more effective.  

### **How to Improve Listening and Pronunciation (Linking Sounds)?**  
Listen to music, especially Disney songs, and try to sing along. This will help you improve faster.

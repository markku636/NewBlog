## Introduction  
Our group class's teacher was absent today, So we got a substitute teacher.  
我們的團體課老師今天請假了，所以我們有了一位代課老師。  

The teacher who teach us "how to learn english" and inspire us to learn english in a better way.  
這位老師教我們「如何學習英文」，並激勵我們用更好的方式學習英語。  

## Common sense  
Typically, a normal person learns English in three years, even if you study very hard, it will take 6 months with 12 hours every day.  
通常，一個普通人學英文需要三年，即使你非常努力學習，每天花12小時，也需要6個月。  

Any language school is not magic school, so they don't cast spells which will instantly make anyone fluent.  
任何語言學校都不是魔法學校，所以他們不會施魔法讓你瞬間變得流利。  

## Forgetting cycle  
Sudy -> Learn -> Rarely use -> Go back to your country -> Forgot all  
學習 -> 學會 -> 很少使用 -> 回國 -> 全忘光  

## Basic of Learn Language  
You must know your brain how to learn  
你必須了解你的大腦是如何學習的  

See -> Say > Hear -> See -> Say -> Hear ...  
看 -> 說 -> 聽 -> 看 -> 說 -> 聽...  

Learning any language requires constant repetition.  
學習任何語言都需要不斷重複。  

## Is just studied enough?  
When we were children, we spent 20% to study anything and 80% to practice, for adults, it's the opposite.  
當我們是孩子時，學習佔20%，練習佔80%。但長大後，比例完全反過來了。  

That doesn’t make sense!  
這根本不合理啊！  

## What's the importance of learning english?  
學英文的重要性是什麼？  

The most important thing is "Find what way works for youself!"  
最重要的事情是「找到適合自己的方法！」  

How to find the way for yourself ?  
如何找到自己的學習方式？  

You must find something you are interested in.  
你必須找到讓你感興趣的東西。  

Have you ever experienced hearing a couple fighting and a crowd buzzing in a restaurant?  
你有沒有在餐廳聽過情侶吵架、旁邊一堆人喧鬧的經驗？  

I think that moment you have a power of listening skill even though it's very noisy, for you are very interested in it.  
我覺得那時候你會突然有「超強聽力」，即使很吵，你還是聽得一清二楚，因為你很想知道發生什麼事！  

Actually, when you interested to something, you will learn it quickly, so do something related to your hobby with english is a good way.  
其實，當你對某件事情感興趣時，你會學得更快。所以，找跟你的興趣有關的英文內容來學，是個好方法！  

## In My Case  
我個人的例子  

I really love writing something for my blog, and I spent some time watching talk show videos. I usually go jogging twice a week.  
我真的很喜歡寫部落格文章，也花了很多時間看脫口秀影片。我通常每週會跑步兩次。  

### **Actions**  
**行動**  

I thought that is right. I must change the methods to learn English.  
我覺得這是對的。我必須改變學英文的方法。  

- Practice writing articles in English.  
  用英文練習寫文章。  
- Improve listening skills by watching talk shows.  
  看脫口秀影片提升聽力。  
- Set all system languages on my phone and PC to English.  
  把手機和電腦系統語言全部設成英文。  
- Listen to English audio regularly.  
  定期聽英文音檔。  
- Watch movies with captions.  
  看有字幕的電影。  

The most importance of things is  
最重要的是  

If you leave your country to learn English, don’t rely on the same methods you used in your home country. Otherwise, the experience will be similar to studying in your own country.  
如果你出國學英文，不要依賴在自己國家用過的同樣方法。否則，結果會跟在自己國家學差不多。  

### **Teacher's Suggestions**  
**老師的建議**  

#### **How to Prepare for TOEIC**  
**如何準備多益**  

- Increase listening speed.  
  提高聽力速度。  
- Familiarize yourself with different accents.  
  熟悉不同口音。  

#### **Should You Turn Off Captions When Watching Movies?**  
**看電影要關字幕嗎？**  

If your English level is still low and you only understand a few words, watching without captions might be too challenging. In this case, turning on captions is more effective.  
如果你的英文程度還很初級，只能聽懂幾個單詞，那不開字幕可能會太難。  
在這種情況下，**開字幕**學習會比較有效。  

Watching **50 short videos (5 minutes each) per week** is a great way to improve.  
每週**看50部5分鐘短片**是個提升的好方法。  

#### **How to Memorize Vocabulary?**  
**如何記單字？**  

As a child, memorizing vocabulary was easy, but now it takes much longer to remember just one word.  
小時候背單字很容易，但現在可能背一個單詞都要很久才能記住。  

Even in our native language, we don’t memorize vocabulary, we learn it naturally through use.  
其實，就算是我們的母語，也不是靠死背單字學來的，而是在使用中自然學會的。  

Instead of just making sentences, try creating questions and answers. This method is more effective.  
**與其只是造句，不如試試自己創造問題和答案**，這樣更有效！  

#### **How to Improve Listening and Pronunciation (Linking Sounds)?**  
**如何提升聽力和發音連音？**  

Listen to music, especially Disney songs, and try to sing along. This will help you improve faster.  
聽音樂，特別是迪士尼的歌曲，試著跟著唱。這樣會進步得更快！

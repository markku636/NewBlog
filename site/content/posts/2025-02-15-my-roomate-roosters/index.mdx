The story happened when I was studying at a language school in Baguio.

Have you ever heard of Baguio’s rooster crow?  

In Taiwan, our roosters are very polite.  
They crow at 6 or 7 AM—never too early, never too late.  
They follow the rules!  

Even wild roosters in Taiwan don’t make too much noise.  
Because if they do… well, they become dinner.

But when I came to Baguio, my life changed.  
I didn’t just hear one rooster—I heard a thousand！  

And they don’t just crow at sunrise.  
Some of them crow at 11 PM! and the voices are very shrill.  

I was so confused.
Are they working night shifts? Are they overwork?  Maybe I must report to government.

Then, I discovered the truth…
This is not a normal rooster.

It is a… fighting rooster.

No wonder it was so aggressive and arrogant.
And guess what? It lived right behind my room.

My friends gave me advice:

One said, “Maybe you should buy BB gun to shot him.”

Another one said, “Dont’t do that. That’s not kind.  
Just eat fried chicken in front of it as a warning it.”

Yep! Sounds good. I think those roosters will get PTSD.

But in the end, I found the best solution…  

Then I closed outside windows, locked outside door…  
And prayed for inner peace.

description: My first roommate's roosters in Baguio
---
The story happened when I was studying at a language school in Baguio.

Have you ever heard of Baguio’s rooster crow?  

In Taiwan, our roosters are very polite.  
They crow at 6 or 7 AM. It was never too early, never too late.
They follow the rules!  

Even wild roosters in Taiwan don’t make too much noise.  
Because if they do… well, they become dinner.

But when I came to Baguio, my life changed.  
I didn’t just hear one rooster. Actually I heard a thousand near my dormitory！  

And they don’t just crow at sunrise.  
Some of them crow at 11 PM! and the voices are very shrill.  

I was so confused.
Are they working night shifts? Are they overwork?  Maybe I must report to government.

Then, I discovered the truth…
This is not a normal rooster.  

Well... It is a… fighting rooster.

No wonder it was so aggressive and arrogant.
And guess what? There are three cages behind my room.

Then I started learning about chickens.  

My friends gave me advice:

One said, “Maybe you should buy BB gun to shot him.”

Another one said, “Dont’t do that. That’s not kind.  
Just eat fried chicken in front of it as a warning it.”

Yep! Sounds good! I think The roosters will get PTSD.

But in the end, I found the way to reduce rooster's noise.

Then I closed outside windows, locked outside door…  
And prayed for inner peace.

Just kidding!  
Actually, I adapted the enviorment.
